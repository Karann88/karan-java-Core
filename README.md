# Java Core Practice & Learning Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Java programs, algorithms, and data structure implementations. It is designed for learning, practicing, and mastering core Java concepts, as well as preparing for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into topic-based folders and files, each focusing on a specific area of Java or computer science:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
	- `Sorting/` — Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Cyclic Sort, and related questions
	- `BinarySearch/` — Binary search, Rotated arrays, Mountain arrays, 2D matrix search
	- `LinkedList/` — Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists, sorting, merging, and cycle detection
	- `Trees/` — Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees, Segment Trees, and tree-related questions
	- `STACKSQUEUES/` — Stack and Queue implementations and problems
	- `Recursion/` — Recursive algorithms, Fibonacci, N-Queens, permutations, and more
	- `LargeNumbers/` — Factorial and operations on large numbers
	- `LargeStrings/` — String manipulation and random string generation
	- `Practice/` — Practice problems on arrays, matrices, and sorting

- **Core Java Concepts**
	- `OOPs/` — Object-Oriented Programming: abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, generics, static, singleton, and properties
	- `Functions_In_Java/` — Function definitions and practice questions
	- `FileHandling/` — File input/output operations
	- `CollectionFW/` — Java Collections Framework: HashMap, Vector, CopyOnWriterArrayList, Comparator

- **Java 8 Features**
	- `Java8/` — Lambda expressions, Stream API, and related examples

- **LeetCode & Competitive Programming**
	- `LeetCode/` — Solutions to LeetCode problems

- **Other Topics**
	- `Arrays/` — Array basics and practice
	- `Strings/` — String operations and builder usage
	- `Patterns.java` — Pattern printing problems
	- `TicTacToe.java` — Simple Tic Tac Toe game implementation
	- `User.java` — User class example

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
	 ```powershell
	 git clone https://github.com/Karann88/karan-java-Core.git
	 ```
2. **Open in your IDE:**
	 - Recommended: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
3. **Compile and run Java files:**
	 - Each file or folder contains independent programs. You can compile and run them individually:
	 ```powershell
	 javac Main.java
	 java Main
	 ```
	 - For files in subfolders, navigate to the folder and run the above commands.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or higher (preferably latest LTS)
