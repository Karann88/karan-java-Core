## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```powershell
	git clone https://github.com/Karann88/karan-java-Core.git
	```
2. **Open in your preferred IDE:**
	- IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code recommended
3. **Compile and run Java files:**
	- Each file/folder contains independent programs. Compile and run as needed:
	```powershell
	javac Main.java
	java Main
	```
	- For subfolders, navigate to the folder and run the above commands.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or higher (latest LTS recommended)
