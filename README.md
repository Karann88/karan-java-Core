## ‚ú® Features

*   üìö **Extensive Java Core Coverage:** Dive deep into fundamental Java topics including `Arrays`, `Conditions_loops`, `Functions_In_Java`, `Methods`, `Strings`, and `OOPs`.
*   üí° **Algorithm & Data Structure Focus:** Explore implementations of `BinarySearch`, `LinearSearch`, `Sorting`, `LinkedList`, `STACKSQUEUES`, and `Trees`.
*   üß† **Problem Solving Practice:** Sharpen your skills with dedicated sections for `LeetCode` problems and general `Practice` exercises.
*   ‚òï **Modern Java Features:** Discover and understand concepts introduced in `Java8`.
*   üìÅ **Well-Organized Structure:** Navigate through a clearly defined project structure, making it easy to find specific topics and examples.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher:**
    *   You can download it from Oracle's official website or use an open-source distribution like OpenJDK.
    *   Verify your Java version:
        ```bash
        java -version
        javac -version
        ```

### Manual Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Karann88/karan-java-Core.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd karan-java-Core
    ```
3.  **Open in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code):**
    *   **IntelliJ IDEA:** Open IntelliJ IDEA, select `File` > `Open`, and navigate to the `karan-java-Core` directory.
    *   **VS Code:** Open VS Code, select `File` > `Open Folder`, and select the `karan-java-Core` directory. Ensure you have the Java Extension Pack installed for full functionality.

4.  **Build the project (if necessary):**
    *   Most modern IDEs will automatically detect and build the Java project. If not, look for a "Build Project" option in your IDE's menu.


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once installed, you can explore and run individual Java files within the respective topic folders.

### Running a specific Java program

Let's say you want to run an example from the `Arrays` directory:

1.  **Navigate to the specific file (e.g., `Arrays/ArrayExample.java`):**
    ```bash
    cd karan-java-Core/Arrays
    ```
2.  **Compile the Java file:**
    ```bash
    javac ArrayExample.java
    ```
3.  **Run the compiled class:**
    ```bash
    java ArrayExample
    ```

### Example: Hello World (Conceptual)

While not directly in the structure, here's how you'd run a typical Java program:

```java
// FirstJavaProgram/HelloWorld.java (conceptual path)
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java Core!");
    }
}
```

To compile and run this:

```bash
# Assuming you are in the FirstJavaProgram directory
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```
